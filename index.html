        <p>I want you by my side
        <br>
        So that I never feel alone again
        <br>
        They've always been so kind
        <br>
        But now they've brought you away from me
        <br>
        I hope they didn't get your mind
        <br>
        Your heart is too strong anyway
        <br>
        We need to fetch back the time
        <br>
        They have stolen from us</p>
        <br>
        <br> 
        <p>To me this song represents community because when I think of community, I think of all of my lovely friends. Sometimes when I listen to this song I can remember of a time in high school where me and a few of my girl friends at the time where spending the at a friends house and her parents were out on a date night. We blasted music the whole time they were gone and danced our hearts away. Now when I'm hanging out with my friends, same ones or new faces, and were singing and dancing to music, I get a sense of deja- vu because I recall being younger doing a similar thing. To me, this song represents my community because my friends make me feel alive theough this song.</p>
