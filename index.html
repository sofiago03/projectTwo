        <p>I want you by my side
        <br>
        So that I never feel alone again
        <br>
        They've always been so kind
        <br>
        But now they've brought you away from me
        <br>
        I hope they didn't get your mind
        <br>
        Your heart is too strong anyway
        <br>
        We need to fetch back the time
        <br>
        They have stolen from us</p>
        <br>
    </body>
